MLCOE Summer Associate Internship Exercises

## Rules to Remember
- Mandatory tools: Python3, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Probability.
- Unit tests and integration tests

It'd be good if each of our questions are formatted into packages and we ensure our testing & linting is all uniform (I'll sort out automation)

I suggest creating a new branch for each question part & bonus when moving onto them
