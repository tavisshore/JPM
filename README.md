MLCOE Summer Associate Internship Exercises

## N.B.
- Mandatory tools: Python3, Tensorflow, Tensorflow Probability.
- Unit tests and integration tests

## Code Practice
- Update your code in the correct branch, then we can merge into main just before we submit each part
- I've automated linting & CI as pre-commits, would be good to double check these once we're into it
- I think if we always add new tests before pushing new functions, this'll help us keep on top of that
